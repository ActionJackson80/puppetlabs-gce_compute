manage as puppet devices (I really wish they supported puppet apply)

# each device entry is for a project
# each device is actually a project!!!

The google compute engine native types and providers can be used
to describe application stacks using Puppet resources.

These resource types have been implement as devices.

Each project should have an entry in

/etc/puppet/device.conf

[certname]
  type cisco
  url [~/gcutil_auth]:my_project

This is the first iteration of native types for google compute.

Only the gce_instance type has been implemented.
It has no properties
It currently supports create and destroy
